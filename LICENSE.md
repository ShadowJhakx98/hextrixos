# LICENSE.md

**Effective Date:** February 27, 2025
**Version:** 3.1

---

## 1. Definitions

- **Software**: The Hextrix Ai system, including all neural architectures (e.g., GPT-4o integration, Jetson AGX Thor edge modules), ethical governance frameworks, and associated documentation.
- **User**: Any individual or entity interacting with the Software.
- **Commercial Use**: Deployment for revenue-generating activities, including enterprise robotics, healthcare diagnostics, or IoT monetization.
- **Edge Deployment**: Operation on NVIDIA Jetson AGX Thor or equivalent embedded systems.

---

## 2. License Grant

### 2.1 Permitted Use

- **Research/Non-Commercial**: Free use for academic research or personal projects, contingent on SFW mode activation for minors[^1][^3].
- **Enterprise Licensing**: Requires signed agreement for:
    - **Cloud Clusters**: NVIDIA H100/A100 GPU deployments exceeding 8 nodes
    - **Quantum Co-Processing**: Integration with Google Willow QPU modules
    - **Domain Modules**: Healthcare (HIPAA-compliant configurations), military, or financial services[^2][^6]
- **Edge Devices**: Limited to 3 Jetson AGX Thor units without commercial license[^2][^4]


### 2.2 Restrictions

- **Redistribution**: Prohibited without written consent, including model weights (quantized or full-precision), Triton Inference Server configurations, or ethical alignment circuits[^1][^5].
- **Reverse Engineering**: Strictly banned for components using:
    - NVIDIA Transformer Engine kernels
    - Quantum-classical hybrid algorithms
    - Constitutional AI guardrails (57 programmable constraints)[^2][^4]
- **Ethical Bypass**: Tampering with real-time harm monitoring (14D vector scoring) or Z3 theorem prover checks voids all warranties[^2][^4].

---

## 3. Intellectual Property

- **Core Ownership**: All rights to neuro-symbolic orchestration logic, hybrid precision pipelines, and cascade failure mitigation systems remain with Jared Edwards[^1][^5].
- **Third-Party Components**: Subsystems using Anthropic HH-RLHF datasets or NVIDIA cuQuantum require separate compliance audits[^2][^6].

---

## 4. Compliance \& Ethics

### 4.1 Regulatory Obligations

Users must maintain:

- **GDPR/CCPA**: Automated DSAR handling via Merkle-tree audit trails (§4.2, Hextrix Ai Architecture Whitepaper)
- **AI Act Conformity**: 89 risk classifiers updated hourly for high-risk deployments[^2][^4]
- **COPPA**: Age verification heuristics (99.2% accuracy) for educational applications[^3][^4]


### 4.2 Ethical Use

- **Content Generation**: NSFW capabilities disabled by default; enablement requires:
    - 18+ age verification via government ID hashing
    - Geo-fencing excluding jurisdictions with strict morality laws[^1][^3]
- **Robotics**: Humanoid systems using Hextrix Ai must implement dual kill switches (software + physical emergency stop)[^4][^6]

---

## 5. Liability

### 5.1 Disclaimers

The Licensor assumes no responsibility for:

- **Edge Computing Failures**: Latency exceeding 500ms SLAs on Jetson Thor deployments[^2][^6]
- **Quantum Errors**: >1.2% decoherence rates in Willow QPU-integrated inferences
- **Ethical Violations**: User-modified constitutional AI parameters (§4.7.2, Compliance Handbook)


### 5.2 User Accountability

Full responsibility applies for:

- **Regulatory Penalties**: \$25k+/violation under EU AI Act Article 52a
- **Security Breaches**: Unencrypted model checkpoints leading to IP theft
- **High-Risk Scenarios**: Unmonitored use in autonomous vehicles or surgical robots[^2][^4]

---

## 6. Termination

Violation of §2.2 or §4.1 triggers:

- **Immediate Revocation**: All edge/cloud licenses
- **Data Erasure**: Homomorphic encryption tombstoning of user-specific model adapters[^2][^4]
- **Penalties**: \$150k minimum for attempted redistribution of quantized submodels[^1][^5]

---

## 7. Modifications

License updates require 90 days' notice except for:

- **Security Patches**: Critical vulnerabilities (CVSS ≥9.0)
- **Regulatory Changes**: GDPR Article 35 amendments or new AI liability directives

---

## 8. Governing Law

Disputes resolved under Delaware General Corporation Law with binding arbitration via AAA Commercial Rules.
