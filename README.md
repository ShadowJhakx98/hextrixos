## Configuration

### API Keys
Store your API keys in `credentials2.json` in the `hud` directory:
```json
{
  "api_keys": {
    "trieve_api_key": "YOUR_TRIEVE_API_KEY",
    "perplexity": "YOUR_PERPLEXITY_API_KEY",
    "serp": "YOUR_SERPAPI_API_KEY",
    "newsapi_api_key": "YOUR_NEWSAPI_API_KEY"
  }
}
```

### Google OAuth
For Google service integration, configure OAuth credentials in the `credentials.json` file in the `hud` directory.

### Environment Variables
- `GI_TYPELIB_PATH`: Path to GObject introspection typelibs
- `PYTHONPATH`: Path to AI modules
- `GTK_CSD`: Set to 0 on Windows for native window decorations

## Troubleshooting

### VTE Module Issues (Linux)
1. Install VTE typelib:
   ```bash
   sudo apt install -y gir1.2-vte-2.91 libvte-2.91-dev
   ```

2. Set GI_TYPELIB_PATH:
   ```bash
   export GI_TYPELIB_PATH="/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/girepository-1.0:/usr/lib/girepository-1.0:$GI_TYPELIB_PATH"
   ```

### GTK Issues (Windows)
1. Use MSYS2 for reliable GTK support:
   ```powershell
   powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File install_msys2_gtk.ps1
   ```

2. Ensure PATH includes MSYS2 binaries:
   ```
   C:\msys64\mingw64\bin
   ```

### Missing Python Packages

#### For Linux
Use pip with the virtual environment:
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
pip install <package-name>
```

#### For Windows
Use MSYS2's package manager:
```bash
pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-python-<package-name>
```
